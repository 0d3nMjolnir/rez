# This section maps the egg platform to a list of rez packages. Eggs typically describe the platform
# they are built on in their metadata, keyed under 'Platform'. Typical values include 'unknown',
# 'any' and 'unix'. You probably have rez packages already installed that describe the current 
# platform - for example, you may have the packages 'Linux', 'x86_64' and 'centos-6.3'. This file
# lets you associate rez packages with egg platforms. Note that the association is NON-case sensitive.
platform_mappings:
  unknown:  []
  any:      []
  all:      []
  unix:     [Linux, x86_64, centos-6.3]  # this is just an example!


# This section remaps egg names to internal rez package names that your studio wants to use instead.
# For example, ILM provides an 'OpenEXR' egg, but you might already have an 'OpenEXR' rez package, 
# which is actually the C++ library and headers. In that case you might want to call the package 
# 'PyOpenEXR' instead - use this file to do so. Note that the association IS case-sensitive.

package_mappings:
  OpenEXR:  PyOpenEXR  # this is just an example!

/**
\mainpage %(USER)s has not written any documentation yet!

To make matters worse, you're using an old (< 1.8) version of Doxygen! You should upgrade to 1.8 or 
higher, if you do you will get markdown support, and nicer documentation will be generated for you.

After you've upgraded Doxygen, you can simply remove this .dox file - you won't need it, and Doxygen
will start using the <package>/docs/mainpage.md file instead.

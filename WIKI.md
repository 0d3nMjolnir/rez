# Rez Documentation

Rez uses the GitHub Wiki system for its documentation. To update:

    ]$ git clone git@github.com:nerdvegas/rez.wiki.git

Then follow the README.md instructions in that repository.

Rez is not currently accepting documentation PRs - GutHub doesn't support this
natively and I have to jump through some hoops to support it.

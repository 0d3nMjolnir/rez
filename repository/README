This is a repository of package installers. Each directory contains a rez
project that you need to build (using rez-build) or release (using rez-release).

Please note that this project repository is for reference only. You should copy
them into your own repo - at that point you can set the correct versions, put a
requirement on your operating system of choice, and so on. Where package versions
contain an 'x', they indicate that you need to replace 'x' with a version of the
software you have downloaded, and then the install should work.

Once you have these installer packages in your own repo (or repos) you will be
able to rez-build and rez-release them. You can keep them all within a single
repo, or split them out into separate repos, the choice is yours and both will
work.

The following environment variables are used by some packages:

REZ_REPO_PAYLOAD_DIR: Path to where package downloads (typically tgz files) are
	stored. Source disappears online and security measures often mean it is
	difficult to install from URL within a studio, so we opt to install from
	already downloaded source, rather than downloading as part of the install.
